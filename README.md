Theese are some projects where I've used webscraping and visualization techniques to extract data and visualize them.
Here, I use: pandas, json, requests, NumPy, yfinance, matplotlib, BeautifulSoup

1-banana.ipynb gets different fruits data from a url and creats a pandas dataframe for setting it up
2-compare-stocks.py is a small project to get stocks history data with yfinance and visualize thrm to compare
3-find-links gets the links in a url using Beautifulsoup
4-jokes.ipynb gets random jokes in Englisk or Spanish
5-ms-stocks gets stocks data from microsoft and represets the dataset
